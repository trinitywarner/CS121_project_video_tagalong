#include <stdio.h>
// stdio.h is a library of standard input and output 
// including a library is to use <>, as shown above

// this begins the function, main, this is great for organizing and is a necessity to do most things
// function has a return type
// {} indicates starting and ending blocks (beginning and end) 
// () is there to set parameters, not neccessary entirely
// printf is c's way of saying print format
// \n means new line
// ; this means to end a line, like normal punctuation
// return means to return an error code-- the function, but if there are no errors, just return a 0 

int main(){
	printf("Hello World! from me! \n");
	return(0);
}
